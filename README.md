# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Learning

## Introduction:

In our final project at T5 bootcamp we will build models that can detect the presence of pneumonia with chest X-rays using Deep Convololutional Neural Network.
Chest X-rays are currently the best available method for diagnosing pneumonia, playing a crucial role in clinical care. 
Over 150 million people get infected with pneumonia on an annual basis especially children under 5 years old.


## Problem Statement:

Providing a clinical aid for higher accuracy image reads of diseases that are hard to diagnose.
Clinical diagnoses from chest X-rays can be challenging, however, even by skilled radiologists.
The diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays is difficult for several reasons:
1. The appearance of pneumonia in a chest X-ray can be very vague depending on the stage of the infection
2. Pneumonia often overlaps with other diagnoses


## Dataset description:

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, validation). 
There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). 
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected of pediatric patients of one to five years old. 


## Objectives:
- [x] High accuracy 
- [x] Less medical test 
- [x] Low cost 
- [x] Reduce time
